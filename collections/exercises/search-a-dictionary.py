### Search a Dictionary Part 2:

## Initialize two variables: highest_cost to 0 and fanciest to an empty string.
highest_cost = 0

## Loop through the flavors dictionary using a for loop.

for flavor in flavors.keys():

## For each flavor, check if its price is higher than highest_cost.
  if flavors[flavor] > highest_cost:

## If it is, update fanciest to this flavor and highest_cost to its price.
    fanciest = flavor
    highest_cost = flavors[flavor]
## After the loop, print the most expensive flavor.
print(f"The fanciest flavor is {fanciest} at ${flavors[fanciest]}.")
